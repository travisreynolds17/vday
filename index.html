        <h2>So the other day</h2>
        <p>
          My new boss asked if I was married, dating, that sort of thing. So, of
          course, I told him about you. What's she like, he asked?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I said, she is <span class="bold">fierce</span>. If I had a
          tenth of her strength, her dedication, her stand-up-to-it-ness, I'd be
          unstoppable. Unflappable. Sir, said I, if I was anything like her, I
          could not. Be. Flapped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also told him you're hot, because I am a purveyor of the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess, I told him, the thing I like most about you is that I feel
          like I could trust anything to be safe with you. Not just little
          things like watching a pet for a weekend or something. Like, I could
          trust the future with you. You just kind of
          <span class="bold">are</span>. You's a force of nature, lady.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love you, Shannon. Sometimes I'm infuriating, I know, but it's
          because somewhere deep down I'm sure you're out of my league. Happy
          Valentine's Day, sweetness.
